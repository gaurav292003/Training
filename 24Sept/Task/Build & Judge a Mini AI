Build & Judge a Mini AI
Part1
Machine Learning → Fraud Detection
Deep Learning → Voice Assistants 
Computer Vision → Self Driving car
NLP → Sentiment Analysis in Customer Reviews
LLMs → ChatGPT for Customer Support

Part2
Model	Use Case
1. RNN	Early speech-to-text systems
2. LSTM	Text translation (old Google Translate)
3. CNN	Image recognition
4. Transformer	Predicting the next word in ChatGPT



Part3
I would use keras because its simple , high level API makes building and training a cat vs dog classifier quick and beginner friendly while leveraging TensorFlow under the hood.

•	Precision= 7/10
      = 0.70
      = 70%
•	Recall = 7/12
               = 0.5833
	= 58.33%
•	F1 Score = 2* Precision* Recall/(Precision + Recall)
     = 0.64
•	MSE/MAE 
Error= 3
MAE= 3
MSE = 9
•	BLEU would give a higher score since most candidate words match the reference, while ROUGE drops due to the missing word “sat”.
